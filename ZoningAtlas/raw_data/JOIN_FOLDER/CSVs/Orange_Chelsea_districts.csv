Notes - Write any explanations here.,"Separate Flood Hazard Bylaw for permitting: https://www.chelseavt.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Chelsea_Flood_Hazard_Area_Bylaw_11.7.17.pdf - all housing is prohibited in the special flood hazard area unless unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed structure would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Since housing is allowed if it meets that condition, I have included it here as ""public hearing required""",,,,,,,,,,Appears in legend of official zoning map. Overlay not apparent on map itself.
